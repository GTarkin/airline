## Welcome

Welcome to the Airline Users Guide, this guide is intended to show you how to use every aspect of Airline.

## Getting Started

### Adding a Dependency

At a bare minimum you will need to add a dependency on the `airline` library to your project, assuming Maven you can do this like so:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.rvesse</groupId>
  <artifactId>airline</artifactId>
  <version>X.Y.Z</version>
</dependency>
```

Where `X.Y.Z` is your desired version, the current stable release is `{{ site.version }}`

### Simple Command Example

```java

```
