title: Parser Annotation

## `@Parser`

The `@Parser` annotation is applied to classes also annotated with `@Command` to configure the parser behaviour for that single command.  It may also be used as an argument to the `@Cli` annotation (see the [CLI Annotation](cli.html) documentation) in order to configure parser behaviour for a CLI.
