title: Parser Annotation
---

## `@Parser`

The `@Parser` annotation is applied to classes also annotated with `@Command` to configure the parser behaviour for that single command when parsers are created using `SingleCommand.singleCommand()`.

It may also be used as an argument to the [`@Cli`](cli.html) annotation in order to configure parser behaviour for a CLI.

**TODO Write up @Parser annotation**
