Airline includes a powerful and extensible restrictions system that allows users to significantly reduce the boiler plate code typical of many CLI libraries.  Restrictions work by simply applying appropriate annotations to the [`@Option`](../annotations/option.html) or [`@Arguments`](../annotations/arguments.html) annotated fields that you wish to restrict and Airline handles all the work of enforcing those restrictions for you.
