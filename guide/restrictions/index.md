Airline includes a powerful and extensible restrictions system that allows users to significantly reduce the boiler plate code typical of many CLI libraries.  Restrictions work by simply applying appropriate annotations to the `@Option` or `@Arguments` annotated fields that you wish to restrict and Airline handles all the work of enforcing those restrictions for you.
