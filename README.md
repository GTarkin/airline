# Airline

Airline is a Java library providing an annotation-based framework for parsing command line interfaces.  It supports both simple and advanced use cases.

This is a fork of the original library created based on improvements both by myself and taken from the [Clark & Parsia](https://github.com/clarkparsia/airline) fork
